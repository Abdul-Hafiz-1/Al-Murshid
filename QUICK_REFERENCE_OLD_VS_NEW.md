## The New Strict Rules

### ✅ EXACT MATCH
```
If all letters are exactly the same → CORRECT
```

### ✅ ALIF VARIANTS (All equivalent)
```
ا (plain alif)
آ (alif with madda)
إ (alif with hamza below)
أ (alif with hamza above)
ٱ (alif wasla)

All → treated as same letter → CORRECT
```

### ✅ YA VARIANTS
```
ي (ya)
ئ (hamza on ya)

Both → treated as same letter → CORRECT
```

### ✅ WAW VARIANTS
```
و (waw)
ؤ (hamza on waw)

Both → treated as same letter → CORRECT
```

### ✅ ALIF MAKSURA vs YA
```
ى (alif maksura)
ي (ya)

Both pronounced "ee" → treated as same → CORRECT
```

### ✅ TA MARBUTA vs HA (AT END ONLY)
```
Word ending in ة (ta marbuta) vs ه (ha)

Only at end → treated as equivalent → CORRECT
In middle → treated as different → WRONG
```

### ✅ DIACRITICS DON'T MATTER
```
Fatha (َ) vs Damma (ُ) vs Kasra (ِ) → Doesn't matter
Shadda (ّ) vs No shadda → Doesn't matter
Sukun (ْ) vs Tanwin (ً/ٌ/ٍ) → Doesn't matter
```

### ✅ ARTICLE AL (ال) IS OPTIONAL
```
"الرحمن" vs "رحمن" → Both correct
"المغلوبي" vs "مغلوبي" → Both correct
```

### ❌ EVERYTHING ELSE = WRONG
```
Any other letter difference → WRONG
Missing letters → WRONG
Extra letters → WRONG
Different consonants anywhere → WRONG
```

## The Bottom Line

**OLD SYSTEM:** Accepted many variations, marked some wrong pronunciations as correct ❌

- Easy mistakes (ه vs ح) are now caught
- App becomes real practice tool
- Rahman and Magloobi require exact pronunciation

If you're getting marked WRONG now when you thought you were right:
→ Check your letters carefully, pronounce each letter distinctly
→ Long-press word to see the exact pronunciation guide
→ Practice in quiet place with clear voice
→ The app is now enforcing correctness - this is GOOD!

If you can say a word and it's marked CORRECT:
→ Your pronunciation is actually correct
